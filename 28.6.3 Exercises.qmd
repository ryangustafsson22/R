```{r}

#| label: setup

#| include: false

library(tidyverse)

smaller <- diamonds |> 

  filter(carat <= 2.5)

```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds.

Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats.

The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r}

#| label: fig-carat

#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Graph Showing Count of Smaller Diamonds"
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 3
#| out-width: 100%
#| out-width: 20%
smaller |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)

```

![Diamond Image](images/clipboard-476197834.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

As shown in Figure @fig-carat, most smaller diamonds are under 1 carat.

I could tell that the width and height code adjusted the figures width and height, but I am not sure what the second two lines of code are supposed to do to the figure.
